1. Sum Items in List
Create a function that takes in a the list below and returns the sum of all the
values in the list.

(Copy this into your python file)
monthly_costs: float = [121.98, 879.45, 19.00, 23.99, 83.01, 43.22]


2. Get Largest Number in List
Given the list below, find the largest and smallest values of the list.

(Copy this into your python file)
number_list: list[int] = [
            155, 446, 753, 368, 173, 459, 858, 772, 826, 54, 114, 925, 869,
            220, 306, 293, 907, 169, 662, 302, 157, 133, 298, 383, 67, 82, 972,
            803, 574, 663, 519, 48, 468, 685, 202, 950, 35, 939, 906, 845, 210,
            7, 422, 152, 393, 247, 337, 91, 68, 571, 313, 553, 77, 350, 529,
            694, 997, 936, 642, 135, 629, 424, 224, 531, 813, 46, 781, 504,
            648, 944, 477, 834, 666, 653, 734, 369, 926, 31, 63, 665, 352, 142,
            66, 521, 851, 389, 912, 38, 402, 355, 192, 913, 824, 250, 385, 917,
            933, 968, 562, 61
        ]


3. String length
Given the list of strings below, write a function that calculates the average
length of the strings in the list. The function should take a list as its 
parameter

(Copy this into your python file)
word_list: list = [
    "apple", "banana", "cherry", "delta", "eagle", "forest", "giraffe",
    "honey", "island", "jungle", "kangaroo", "lemon", "monkey", "nectar",
    "orange", "peach", "quartz", "river", "sunset", "tiger", "umbrella",
    "violet", "water", "xenon", "yellow", "zebra", "waiter", "wanted"
]

4. Create a random list
Create a list of 100 unique random numbers between 1-1000


5. Count the strings with the same ending
Create a function that counts the number of strings that end with a specific
string. The function should take 2 parameters, the string list and the ending
string and return only the count.
NOTE: Use the values below to test

(Copy this into your Python file)
word_list: list = [
    "apple", "banana", "cherry", "delta", "eagle", "forest", "giraffe",
    "honey", "island", "jungle", "kangaroo", "lemon", "monkey", "nectar",
    "orange", "peach", "quartz", "river", "sunset", "tiger", "umbrella",
    "violet", "water", "xenon", "yellow", "zebra", "waiter", "wanted"
]
# Word endings to test with
ending: str = "set" -> Expected = 1
ending: str = "a"   -> Expected = 4
ending: str = "wa"  -> Expected = 0
ending: str = ""    -> Expected = 28

6. Reverse list
Write a function that takes a list as its parameter and returns a list of the same
values but the order of the list is reversed.
Note: Don't use Python list's reverse function. Do it yourself :)


7. Working with S-parameters
The 2D-Matrix below represents the S-parameters coming back from a network analyser.
We've measured the S-parameters (insertion and reflection) for a single board over
50 discreate frequencies.
The matrix is as follows
Board measuremente[
    [S11],
    [S22],
    [S12],
    [S21]
]
i. Calculate the average value for each of the S-parameters.
ii. Calculate the Square root([Each S21 value] + [the S11 average]). this should result
    in a 1D array (List).
iii. Calculate the S11 - S12 for each value


rf_board: list[list[int]] = [
    [
        48, 90, 52, 23, 93, 39, 26, 12, 53, 63, 88, 37, 80, 34, 16, 81, 22, 40,
