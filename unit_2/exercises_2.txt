If statement Exercises
======================
1. Vowel or Consonant
In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. 
If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that 
the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a 
message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise 
your program should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.


2. Faces on Money
It is common for images of a country’s previous leaders, or other individuals of 
historical significance, to appear on its money. The individuals that appear on banknotes in 
the United States are listed below. Write a program that begins by reading the
denomination of a banknote from the user. Then your program should display the name of the 
individual that appears on thebanknote of the entered amount. An appropriate error message 
should be displayed if no such note exists.

George Washington       $1
Thomas Jefferson        $2
Abraham Lincoln         $5
Alexander Hamilton      $10
Andrew Jackson          $20
Ulysses S. Grant        $50
Benjamin Franklin       $100


3. Richter Scale
The following table contains earthquake magnitude ranges on the Richter scale and
their descriptors:

Magnitude               Descriptor
Less than 2.0           Micro
2.0 to less than 3.0    Very minor
3.0 to less than 4.0    Minor
4.0 to less than 5.0    Light
5.0 to less than 6.0    Moderate
6.0 to less than 7.0    Strong
7.0 to less than 8.0    Major
8.0 to less than 10.0   Great
10.0 or more            Meteoric

Write a program that reads a magnitude from the user and displays the appropriate descriptor 
as part of a meaningful message. For example, if the user enters 5.5 then your program should 
indicate that a magnitude 5.5 earthquake is considered to be a moderate earthquake.






Loop Exercises
==============
4. Average
In this exercise you will create a program that computes the average of a collection of values 
entered by the user. The user will enter 0 as a sentinel value to indicate that no further 
values will be provided. Your program should display an appropriate error message if the 
first value entered by the user is 0.
Hint: Because the 0 marks the end of the input it should not be included in the average.


5. Temperature Conversion Table
Write a program that displays a temperature conversion table for degrees Celsius and degrees 
Fahrenheit. The table should include rows for all temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees 
Celsius that are multiples of 10 degrees Celsius. Include appropriate headings on your columns. 
The formula for converting between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit can be found on the 
internet.


6. Heads and tails
Write a program that works out the average of heads and tails of a coin flip. The program needs
to ask the user to enter the amount of coin tosses the program is to use. The program will then
simulate the specified number of coin tosses and display the amount of heads, tails and the 
average of each.
Hint: Use the random module and the randint fucntion.


7. Star tree
Using loops create a star tree as seen below. The number of stars in each row is the number of
the loop iteration.

Function Exercises
==============
8. Compute the Hypotenuse
Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as its 
parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean theorem, as 
the function’s result. Include a main program that reads the lengths of the shorter sides of a 
right triangle from the user, uses your function to compute the length of the hypotenuse, and 
displays the result.


9. Shipping Calculator
An online retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate of $10.95 for the 
first item, and $2.95 for each subsequent item. Write a function that takes the number of items 
in the order as its only parameter. Return the shipping charge for the order as the function’s 
result. Include a main program that reads the number of items purchased from the user and 
displays the shipping charge.


10.Median of Three Values
Write a function that takes three numbers as parameters, and returns the median value of those 
parameters as its result. Include a main program that reads three values from the user and 
displays their median.
Hint: The median value is the middle of the three values when they are sorted into ascending 
order. It can be found using if statements, or with a little bit of mathematical creativity.


11. Capitalize It
Write a function that takes one string parameter. It should then capitalise the first and last
letter and return the string.
