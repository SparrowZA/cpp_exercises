## Progression Path

These exercises are designed to be completed in order:
- **Beginner:** Units 1-2 (basic syntax and logic)
- **Intermediate:** Units 3-4 (functions and data structures)
- **Advanced:** Units 5-6 (complex data structures and file handling)

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (g++, clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.)
- Basic command line familiarity

## Tips for Success

- Read exercise descriptions carefully before coding
- Start with simpler exercises and progress at your own pace
- Test your code with multiple input cases
- Review your code for clarity and efficiency
- Experiment with different approaches to problems
